#ALGORITHM


Step 1:Concatenate the given string s with a special character (not present in s, such as #) and its reverse.
Step2:Build KMP Table:
Initialize an array table of length len(new_str) with zeros.
Initialize a variable j to 0.
Iterate over the characters of new_str starting from index 1.
Use a while loop to update j based on the KMP algorithm.
If characters at indices i and j are equal, increment j.
Update the KMP table value at index i.
Step3:Find Palindrome Length:
Find the length of the longest prefix that matches a suffix in new_str
Step4:Construct Shortest Palindrome:
Prepend the remaining characters of the reversed string to the original string to make it a palindrome.
Step5:Return Result:
Return the constructed palindrome.


#LOGIC 

The logic for finding the shortest palindrome using the K pattern matching algorithm involves building a table based on the KMP algorithm 
and then utilizing it to identify the longest prefix that matches a suffix. 
And then logic follows as same as the algorithm
